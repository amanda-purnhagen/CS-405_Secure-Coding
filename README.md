CS-405_Secure-Coding

## Describe secure coding standards and why you should adopt them.
Secure coding standards guide software developers on how to eliminate as many vulnerabilities in their application code as possible. They should be adopted and referred to all throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure that the program is built on a solid foundation.

For example, the project team should set up an exhaustive logging, monitoring, and flagging system that alerts administrators when there is abnormal network traffic or access to protected systems or data. As another example, potential threats should have threat levels that allow people to understand with a glance how severe an existing risk is. 

Close attention should also be paid to the secure coding standards that are specific to the programming language that the software is written in. For example, C++ does not have automatic memory allocation and deallocation, so the code should be meticulously written to manage memory.

## Why should you never leave security protocols for the end of a project?
You should never leave security protocols for the end of a project for many reasons. If a project development team writes a piece of software with little or no consideration for software security, then vulnerabilities will exist deep within the code. It is much harder to patch vulnerabilities in a program's faulty foundation if there are already additional components built on top of it or dependent on it. Fixing this will require far more project resources compared to if security was an essential focal point throughout the entire project.

## Evaluate and assess the risk and cost benefit of vulnerability mitigation.
The risk and cost benefit of vulnerability mitigation is invaluable. Keeping the team's collective eye out for potential vulnerabilities starting with the planning and designing phases is far more cost- and risk-efficient than programming "normally" with no regards to software security. It is far more risky and costly to evaluate the projects' weak points after everything is already written. More resources will be spent trying to refactor components that were already considered finished. More risks will exist since additional code was written on top of vulnerable code.

## What is zero trust?
Zero trust is a secure coding policy that advises against trusting any user or action within the network or application. This policy may seem overly pessimistic until you realize that malicious attackers can gain access to the network or application, appearing as though they are there with permission. Therefore, extra precautions are taken to prevent things like lateral movement within the network, granting too many privileges to user or group roles, or ignoring logged events because they look normal at first glance.

## Which security policies do I choose to implement? Which do I recommend?
As a future professional computer software developer, I implement and recommend the security policies that are the most relevant to the field of secure coding. This means refamiliarizing myself with the chosen programming language's secure coding standards, formatting projects in a way that promotes obfuscation and zero-trust input checks, ensuring that new patches are provided consistently to make sure third-party service versions are up to date, etc. I remain concerned with things like physical site security, network security, and keeping my eye out for phishing attempts, but I would need more information about my future organization's allocation of cybersecurity personnel and tasks before I take on those responsibilities.
