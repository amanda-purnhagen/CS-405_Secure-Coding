CS-405_Secure-Coding

## Describe secure coding standards and why you should adopt them.
Secure coding standards guide software developers on how to eliminate as many vulnerabilities in their application code as possible. They should be adopted and referred to all throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure that the program is built on a solid foundation.

For example, the project team should set up an exhaustive logging, monitoring, and flagging system that alerts administrators when there is abnormal network traffic or access to protected systems or data. As another example, potential threats should have threat levels that allow people to understand with a glance how severe an existing risk is. 

Close attention should also be paid to the secure coding standards that are specific to the programming language that the software is written in. For example, C++ does not have automatic memory allocation and deallocation, so the code should be meticulously written to manage memory.

## Why should you never leave security protocols for the end of a project?
You should never leave security protocols for the end of a project for many reasons. If a project development team writes a piece of software with little or no consideration for software security, then vulnerabilities will exist deep within the code. It is much harder to patch vulnerabilities in a program's faulty foundation if there are already additional components built on top of it or dependent on it. Fixing this will require far more project resources compared to if security was an essential focal point throughout the entire project.

## Evaluate and assess the risk and cost benefit of vulnerability mitigation.
The risk and cost benefit of vulnerability mitigation is invaluable. 

## What is zero trust?

## Which security policies do I choose to implement? Which do I recommend?
